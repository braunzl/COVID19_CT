# What is this?
This is a fork of a machine learning model made by Howchihlee (https://github.com/howchihlee/COVID19_CT).
**My goal is to create a reliable ML model that can determine if a patient has COVID-19 based on computed tomography(CT) scans
from a sample of patients that have tested positive and patients that have tested negative.**

This project is being done by by Myself and other Interns as part of the [MISI Internship program](https://www.misiacademy.tech/)
